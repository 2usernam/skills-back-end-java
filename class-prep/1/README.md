These lessons provide a great introduction to how Java programs run, and how to set up the tools you need to work with Java applications. This portion of Lesson 5 is independent from Lessons 1-4, so don't worry about skipping the earlier lessons. However, **be sure to do all of the setup work that this lesson guides you through.**
