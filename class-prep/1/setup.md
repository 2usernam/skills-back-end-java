The steps here will walk you through setting up a repository that you'll use to study example code, work on studios, and complete your first assignment of this unit.

- **Windows users only:** Install [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/). "Didn't we already install Git?" you might ask. Sort of. Git came along with the GitHub for Windows application, but the location of the actual Git executable is fairly hard to track down, and differs from one version of Windows to another. So it's easier to just install this stand-alone Git version in a central location so that it's more accessible to applications like IntelliJ.
- Create a copy of the `LaunchCodeEducation / java-exercises` repo on GitHub by visiting the [repository page](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/java-exercises) and clicking on the *Fork* button below your profile picture at the top right.
- Open IntelliJ.
    - If the app opens up to the "Welcome to IntelliJ" dialog, select *Check out from Version Control > GitHub*
    - If the app opens up to an existing project, select *File > New > Project from Version Control > GitHub*
- The first time you use GitHub within IntelliJ you'll have to configure IntelliJ to use your GitHub Account. We recommend taking the extra step of authenticating using a token. This takes only one brief extra step, and will prevent you from having to update IntelliJ settings if you ever change your GitHub password.
- From the project selection dialog, select the `java-exercises` repository, along with an appropriate source destination directory (i.e. a folder where you've stored other projects for this class).
- When asked "Would you like to create and IDEA project..." select *Yes*, and then accept all of the default options that are presented.

With that, you're ready to go!
