# Class 9

Lecture and Q&A on packages, annotations, and `.equals()`
- Organizing code in packages
- Annotations as metadata
- Comparing objects: What does it mean for two objects to be "equal"? What is a reference?

After lecture, work on [Studio: Equality][equality]

[equality]: ../../materials/studios/equality
