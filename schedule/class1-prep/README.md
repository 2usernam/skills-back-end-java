# Class 1 Prep

If you are new to Java, read [Java for Python Programmers](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/java4python/index.html). This resource is made by the same folks that wrote the platform we used to create the Unit 1 Python curriculum, so the format of the site will look very familiar. Use this as a reference as you adapt to Java from the world of Python.

For now, read the sections the following sections: **Java Data Types**, **Conditionals**, **Loops and Iteration**. As you get settled in to the world of Java, rely on this resource in addition to your classmates, TFs and instructors for help.

If you are familiar with Java, you're all set for class 1.
