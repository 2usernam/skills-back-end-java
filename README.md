# Skill Track: Java Back-end

Welcome! This skill-track is an introduction to back-end Java development.

### Synopsis

The Java track covers the essentials of Java development:

* **Objects and Classes**: An Object is the basis of everything in Java. These powerful constructs have a wide range of uses.
* **GUIs** A graphical user interface is a nice, clean way for users to interact with your program.
* **Unit Tests** are an important piece of any program. We don't know if something works unless we test it!
* **Inheritance and Interfaces** are useful for leveraging common behaviors and functionality across your classes.
* **Exceptions** are used to inform users of invalid inputs or unexpected behaviors.

It will then move into building MVC web applications in Java using the popular Spring framework.

Once you complete these classes, you will be well equipped to create a final project!
