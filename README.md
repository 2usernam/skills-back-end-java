# Skill Track: Java Back-end

Welcome! This skill-track is an introduction to back-end Java development.

### Synopsis

The Java track covers the essentials of object-oriented Java development, along with portions of the Spring framework.

Java is one of the more prominent object-oriented languages, and is widely used by professional programmers. You learned a bit about classes and objects as we completed Unit 1, but we'll dive much deeper this time. In addition to creating classes to serve as blueprints for objects, we'll look at the many ways that class and objects can be used to create robust and flexbile programs.

After covering object-oriented concepts, we'll turn to [Spring](https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/). Spring is a large Java framework that has several large components. We will primiarly on the Spring MVC component, and more precisely Spring Boot. Spring Boot is used to build MVC web applications in Java, including all of the categories of functionality that we saw in Unit 2: templating, database integration, routing, etc.

Once you complete these classes, you will be well equipped to create a final project!

### Topics

#### Object-oriented Topics

* **Objects and Classes**: An Object is the basis of everything in Java. These powerful constructs have a wide range of uses.
* **GUIs** A graphical user interface is a nice, clean way for users to interact with your program.
* **Unit Tests** are an important piece of any program. We don't know if something works unless we test it!
* **Inheritance and Interfaces** are useful for leveraging common behaviors and functionality across your classes.
* **Exceptions** are used to inform users of invalid inputs or unexpected behaviors.
* **Abstract classes** can be thought of as interfaces in which we can provide implementations for some of the methods.

#### Spring MVC Topics

* **Dependency injection** is a technique that allows some of our objects to be created and managed by Spring. It adds flexibility to our programs, and will be an essential part of Spring Boot.
* **Spring Boot** is a special version of Spring MVC that will allow us to easily create full-featured web applications.
* **Templates** As in Unit 2, we'll use templates to display the views of our web apps.
* **Persistence** We'll look at how to set up classes so that Spring can manage storing and retrieving them from a database.
