## Notes

In this video we will cover these aspects of **IntelliJ**:

* How it differs from text editors like Atom and Visual Studio Code
* Different ways to *Run* your program
* How to interpret compiler error messages and correct errors using `alt RETURN` or `alt ENTER`
* How to easily refactor code and rename classes, variables, etc.
* How to find all usages of a method
* Use `command + CLICK` or `ctrl + CLICK` to jump to a method definition from a method usage
