title: 'Studio: Area of a Circle'
currentMenu: studios
---

Get cosy with Java syntax by revisiting one of our early Python programs. We'll create a console program that calculates the area of a circle based on input from the user.

Write a program/class `Area` that prompts the user for a number, and then calculate the area of a circle with that radius and print the result.

> *NOTE:* Recall that the area of a circle is `A = pi * r * r` where `pi` is 3.14 and `r` is the radius.

Here's an example of how your program should work:

```nohighlight
Enter a radius: 2.5
The radius of a circle of radius 2.5 is: 19.625
```

Some questions to ask yourself:
- What data type should the radius be?
- What is the best way to get user input into a variable `radius` of that type?

Create your program/class in the `java-exercises` project within the package `org.launchcode.java.studios`.

## Bonus Missions

1. Add validation to your program. If the user enters a negative number, print an error message and quit.
2. Extend your program further by using a [while or do-while loop](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/while.html), so that when the user enters a negative number they are re-prompted.
