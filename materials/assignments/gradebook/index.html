                    <h3 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h3>
<p>This problem set will give you some practice with encapsulation in Java.</p>
<h3 id="getting-ready">Getting Ready</h3>
<p>Before diving in to the code, get the latest version of the <code>java-oo-exercises</code> repository by following the steps outlined to fetch updates from the main repository in <a href="https://youtu.be/DEDa5qEOP4M?t=4m25s">the git setup video</a>.</p>
<h3 id="using-encapsulation">Using Encapsulation</h3>
<p>Your task is to generate two classes: <code>Student</code> and <code>Course</code></p>
<p>First, take a look at the <code>StudentAndCourseTest.java</code> file. In that file you will see unit tests. Unfortunately, none of the tests will currently pass. You can use these tests as you develop your classes to verify whether they are working as intended. You are also encouraged to write some additional tests of your own. Be sure to test often!</p>
<p>Next, start crafting a <code>Student</code> class. Students have lots of wonderful properties, but we are primarily interested in these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name (first and last)</li>
<li>Student ID</li>
<li>Credits</li>
<li>GPA</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the unit tests for information on data types and property names. Add these properties to your class, create a constructor, create some getters and setters, and test! To test only the <code>Student</code> class before creating the <code>Course</code> class, comment out the Course tests in the test file.</p>
<p>Now we want to add some functionality to our <code>Student</code> class. Add the following methods:</p>
<p><strong><code>getClassStanding()</code></strong> - returns the student's class standing based on how many credits they have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer than 30: Freshman</li>
<li>More than or equal to 30 but less than 60: Sophomore</li>
<li>More than or equal to 60 but less than 90: Junior</li>
<li>More than or equal to 90: Senior</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><code>submitGrade()</code></strong> - this method takes in a course grade (as a value between 0 and 4) and the number of credits for a course, and updates the students GPA accordingly. GPA can be computed by the following formula:</p>
<p>Take the number of credits for a course and multiply it by the grade for that course. This is called the quality score. GPA is computed as the sum of all of the quality scores for each course the student has taken, divided by the total number of credits.</p>
<p>You should also round the GPA so that it only contains three digits after the decimal.</p>
<p><strong><code>computeTuition()</code></strong> - this method returns the total amount of tuition the student has paid. The average cost of tuition for 1 semester in the United States is roughly $20,000. Assume that there are 15 credit hours per semester, and that any &quot;leftover&quot; credits are computed at the proportional rate.</p>
<p><strong><code>createLegacy()</code></strong> - it is not unusual for two students to meet at college, get married, start a family, and send their children to the same school. This method should take two <code>Student</code> objects as parameters (one for each parent) then create a new Student object based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use one parent's full name as the baby's first name, the other parent's full name as the baby's last name</li>
<li>Assign the baby a student ID that is the sum of its parents IDs.</li>
<li>The legacy's estimated GPA will be the average of its parents GPA.</li>
<li>The legacy's estimated number of credits will be the maximum of its parents credits</li>
</ul>
<p>Hint: it may be useful to create an additional constructor!</p>
<p><strong><code>toString()</code></strong> - returns the students full name and student ID</p>
<p>Before moving on, make sure that the tests pass!</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-course-class">Creating a Course class</h3>
<p>The Course class should contain the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Credits</li>
<li>Number of seats remaining</li>
<li>Roster of Students</li>
</ul>
<p>Your roster will need to be an array of <code>Student</code> objects. If you're newer to Java, brush up on <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/arrays.html">arrays in Java</a>.</p>
<p>Refer to the unit tests for information on data types and property names. Add these properties to your class, create a constructor, create some getters and setters, and test! If you commented out the <code>Course</code> tests when working on the <code>Student</code> class, uncomment those tests first.</p>
<p>Next, implement the following functionality:</p>
<p><strong><code>addStudent()</code></strong> - returns a boolean based on whether or not the student was successfully added to the course. Check to make sure that the student has not already enrolled, and update the number of seats remaining. When checking that the student has not already enrolled, use the student's name to compare an enrolled student to the student that you are trying to add.</p>
<p><strong><code>generateRoster()</code></strong> - Returns a String that represents a roster with all of the students in the course. Make sure to omit &quot;empty&quot; seats!</p>
<p><strong><code>averageGPA()</code></strong> - returns the average GPA of all students enrolled in the course. Make sure to omit &quot;empty&quot; seats!</p>
<p><strong><code>toString()</code></strong> - should contain the course number and credits</p>
<h3 id="how-to-submit">How to Submit</h3>
<p>Once you are finished, make sure all of the tests pass.</p>
<p>Then, submit your code on Vocareum. There is a script that will grade your submission automatically. Note: if your code has a package declaration (it will say &quot;package&quot; towards the top), you will need to remove this before submitting your code.</p>
<h3 id="additional-features">Additional Features</h3>
<p>This pset could also be extended to include <code>Department</code>, <code>Instructor</code>, <code>University</code>, and  <code>Semester</code> classes. Try designing some of these and incorporating them into this problem set if you have time. Don't forget to test!</p>
