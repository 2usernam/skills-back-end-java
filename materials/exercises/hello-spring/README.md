# Exercise: Hello, Spring!

If you didn't the first time, watch the [Hello, Spring! video][hello-spring] again and go through each of the steps yourself to set up your own first Spring project.

You can reference the [source code on GitHub][source].

*Note:* After downloading and unzipping the starter files from [start.spring.io](http://start.spring.io/), move them to an appropriate place on your filesystem before importing into Eclipse. This is not done in the video.
