# Exercise: Install MAMP

Visit the [MAMP][mamp] website to download and install MAMP. MAMP is a tool that bundles Apache, MySQL, and PHP (the first M stances for Mac, but MAMP has both Mac and Windows versions).

After installing, follow along with [this walkthrough] to create a new database and user. The linked video walks through the steps on a Mac system, but they are nearly identical on Windows. The main difference is that you likely won't be prompted for your password when launching MAMP, but you may be asked to relax your firewall settings for MAMP.

Instead of the database and user configured in the video, create a database named `hello`, and a user/password pair as `hello`/`launchcode`.
