title: "Exercise: Hello, Templates!"
---

1. If you didn't follow along while initially watching, code along with the [walkthrough video][templates-walkthrough] on adding templates to your application. Code from the first walkthrough, which is the starting point of this walkthrough, is on [GitHub][gh-hello-spring].
2. Pick up where we left off in the walkthrough and add a new form field that let's the user select which language to say "Hello" in. This should work with at least two languages in addition to English. The web has some [inspiration][hello-languages]. You'll need to make some decisions about how to handle this within each element of the MVC app: template (views), controller, and model.
