title: "Exercise: Git Setup"
---

In this exercise, we'll set up our IDE to contain a new project that will include some of the code we'll be working with during the first half of this unit.

To get started, visit [java-oo-exercises repository][java-oo-exercises-repo] on GitHub and then jump into the [walkthrough video][git-walkthrough] to get your project set up.

There is some additional setup to allow you to incorporate changes from the "upstream" repository (i.e. the repository that you forked) into your repository at a later point in time. We'll do this a few times throughout this unit. Get your Eclipse/Git setup ready for this with [another walkthrough video][upstream-setup-walkthrough].
