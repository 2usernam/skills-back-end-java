# Exercise: Git Setup

In this exercise, we'll set up our IDE to contain a new project that will include some of the code we'll be working with during the first half of this unit.

To get started, visit [java-oo-exercises repository][java-oo-exercises-repo] on GitHub. Fork the repository.

Once you have finished setting up your repository on GitHub, you need to create a clone of your repository on your local machine. First, go to the GitHub page for your repository and copy the link:

![GitHub URL]()

Next, open Eclipse and go into your workspace:

Go to File -> Import. Then select Git project from the list:

Next, select "Clone URI":

Paste the link that you copied from BitBucket into the box at the top. Fill in your BitBucket login (not your WUSTL key!) at the bottom:

Keep clicking next until you see the following screen. Make sure the box next to the LaunchCode project is checked:

Once you click "Finish", you should see the project in your workspace. It should contain folders for psets, exercises, studios, and walkthroughs.

###Committing your work

When you are ready to commit your work, right click the project and select Team-> Commit:

Type in a descriptive commit message then push the "Commit and Push" button at the bottom. Make sure to push! If you only commit (without the push) your work will only be saved on your computer, not on GitHub.
